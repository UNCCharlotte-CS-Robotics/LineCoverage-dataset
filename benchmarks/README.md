The file SRLCresults50cities.csv contains computation times and coverage tour costs for several single robot line coverage algorithms. These algorithms are tested on the most populous 50 cities road network dataset extracted from OpenStreetMap.

The algorithms are described in the following papers:

> The Single Robot Line Coverage Problem: Theory, Algorithms and Experiments  
> Agarwal S and Akella S (2020)  
> In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.09861 (2022).

> Approximation algorithms for the single robot line coverage problem.  
> Agarwal S and Akella S (2020)  
> In: Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics XIV. Oulu, Finland, pp. 534â€“550.


The algorithms are implemented in C++ and executed on a desktop computer with an Intel Core i9-7980XE processor. The ILP formulation is executed using Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/). The implementation can be found in the following GitHub repository:
